A Todo application with basic functionalities

## ARCHITECTURE

> This project follows the bloc architecture
> Find out more here: https://github.com/felangel/bloc/blob/master/packages/bloc
> This design pattern helps to separate presentation from business logic. Following the BLoC pattern facilitates testability and reusability. This package abstracts reactive aspects of the pattern allowing developers to focus on writing the business logic.

## Folder Structure
> Project is divided into 3 layers - data, presentation, bloc

lib/bloc -- will contain all bloc files that connects the business logic to UI
lib/presentation - will contain all UI screens
lib/data -- contains models & repositories

## Plugins used
> flutter_bloc - for bloc architecture
> google_fonts - for theming purposes
